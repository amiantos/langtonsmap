# Langton's Map

A constantly evolving procedural map generated by [Langston's ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant), implemented in SpriteKit. Basically: there are four ants on a map, two of lava and two of water. Lava creates land that evolves over time, and water washes away sand, eroding the land.
